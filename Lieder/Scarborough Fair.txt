	Scarborough Fair


	Male part:

	    Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
	    Remember me to one who lives there,
	    For she was once a true love of mine.

	    Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
	    Without any seam or needlework,
	    Then she shall be a true love of mine.

	    Tell her to wash it in yonder well,
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
	    Where never sprung water or rain ever fell,
	    And she shall be a true lover of mine.

	    Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn,
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
	    Which never bore blossom since Adam was born,
	    Then she shall be a true lover of mine. 

	Female part:

	    Now he has asked me questions three,
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
	    I hope he'll answer as many for me,
	    Before he shall be a true lover of mine.

	    Tell him to buy me an acre of land,
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
	    Between the salt water and the sea sand,
	    Then he shall be a true lover of mine.

	    Tell him to plough it with a ram's horn,
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
	    And sow it all over with one peppercorn,
	    And he shall be a true lover of mine.

	    Tell him to sheer't with a sickle of leather,
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
	    And bind it up with a peacock's feather,
	    And he shall be a true lover of mine.

	    Tell him to thrash it on yonder wall,
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme,
	    And never let one corn of it fall,
	    Then he shall be a true lover of mine.

	    When he has done and finished his work.
	    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme:
	    Oh, tell him to come and he'll have his shirt,
	    And he shall be a true lover of mine.
