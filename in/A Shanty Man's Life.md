A shanty man's life  
Is a wearisome one  
Though some say it's free from care  
It's the swinging of an axe  
From morning till night  
In the forest wild and drear  

Transported as we are  
From a lady so fair  
To the banks of some lonely stream  
Where the wolf, bear, and owl  
Give a terrifying howl  
And disturb our nightly dreams  

Oh sleeping at night  
In our bunks without cheer  
While the cold winter winds do blow  
But as soon as the morning  
Star does appear  
To the wild woods we must go  

Had we ale, wine, or beer  
Our spirits far to cheer  
When we're in those woods so wild  
Where a glass of whiskey shone  
When we're in the woods alone  
For to pass away our long exile  

A shanty man's life  
Is a wearisome one  
Tho some say it's free from care  
It's the swinging of an axe  
From morning till night  
In the forest wild and drear
