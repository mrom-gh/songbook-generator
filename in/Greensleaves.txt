Greensleaves


Alas my love you do me wrong,
to cast me off discourteously;
and I have loved you so long,
delighting in your company.

Refrain:
Greensleaves was all my joy,
Greensleaves was my delight.
Greensleaves was my heart of gold,
and who but my lady Greensleaves?

If you intend thus to disdain, 
it does so more enrapture me,
and even so, I still remain,
a lover in captivity.

Refrain

Alas, my love, that you should own
a heart of wanton vanity,
so I must meditate alone
upon your insincerity.

Refrain

Ah, Greensleaves, now fare-well, adieu,
to God I pray to prosper thee.
For I am still thy lover true,
come once again and love me.

Refrain
