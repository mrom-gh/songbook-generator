Lyke Wake Dirge


This ae nighte, this ae nighte
Every nighte and alle
Fire and fleet and candle-lighte
And Christe receive thy saule

When from hence away thou pass
Every nighte and alle
To Brig o' Dread thou com'st at last
And Christe receive thy saule

When from Brig o' Dread thou pass
Every nighte and alle
To Whinny-muir thou com'st at last
And Christe receive thy saule

If ever thou gavest hosen and shoon
Every nighte and alle
Sit thee down and put them on
And Christe receive thy saule

But if hosen and shoon thou ne'er gav'st nane
Every nighte and alle
The whinnes shall prick thee to the bare bane
And Christe receive thy saule

When from Whinny-muir thou pass
Every nighte and alle
To Purgatory fire thou com'st at last
And Christe receive thy saule

If ever thou gavest meat or drink
Every nighte and alle
The fire shall never make thee shrink
And Christe receive thy saule

But if meat or drink thou ne'er gav'st nane
Every nighte and alle
The fire will burn thee to the bare bane
And Christe receive thy saule

This ae nighte, this ae nighte
Every nighte and alle
Fire and sleet and candle-lighte
And Christe receive thy saule
