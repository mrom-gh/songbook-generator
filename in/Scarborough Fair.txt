Scarborough Fair


Male part:

    Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
    Remember me to one who lives there,
    For she was once a true love of mine.

    Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
    Without any seam or needlework,
    Then she shall be a true love of mine.

    Tell her to wash it in yonder well,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
    Where never sprung water or rain ever fell,
    And she shall be a true lover of mine.

    Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
    Which never bore blossom since Adam was born,
    Then she shall be a true lover of mine. 

Female part:

    Now he has asked me questions three,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
    I hope he'll answer as many for me,
    Before he shall be a true lover of mine.

    Tell him to buy me an acre of land,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
    Between the salt water and the sea sand,
    Then he shall be a true lover of mine.

    Tell him to plough it with a ram's horn,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
    And sow it all over with one peppercorn,
    And he shall be a true lover of mine.

    Tell him to sheer't with a sickle of leather,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
    And bind it up with a peacock's feather,
    And he shall be a true lover of mine.

    Tell him to thrash it on yonder wall,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme,
    And never let one corn of it fall,
    Then he shall be a true lover of mine.

    When he has done and finished his work.
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme:
    Oh, tell him to come and he'll have his shirt,
    And he shall be a true lover of mine.
