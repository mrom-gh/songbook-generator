<h1 class="title">Saint James Infirmary</h1>
</header>
<p>It was down in Old Joe’s barroom,<br />
On the corner by the square,<br />
The usual crowd was assembled<br />
And big Joe McKinney was there.</p>
<p>He was standing at my shoulder.<br />
His eyes were bloodshot red;<br />
He turned to the crowd around him,<br />
These are the very words he said:</p>
<p>“I went down to the St. James Infirmary<br />
I saw my baby there,<br />
She’s laid out on a cold white table,<br />
So so cold, so white, so fair.”</p>
<p>“Let her go, let her go, God bless her;<br />
Wherever she may be<br />
She may search this wide world over<br />
She’ll never find a sweet man like me.”<br />
Oh, when I die, bury me<br />
In my high top Stetson hat;<br />
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain<br />
God’ll know I died standin’ pat.</p>
<p>I want six crap shooters for pall bearers.<br />
<em>Chorus</em> girl to sing me a song.<br />
Put a jazz band on my hearse wagon.<br />
Raise Hell as I roll along.</p>
<p>Roll out your rubber tired carriage,<br />
Roll out your old time hat.<br />
Twelve men going to the graveyard<br />
And eleven coming back.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve told my story,<br />
I’ll take another shot of booze.<br />
And if anyone should happen to ask you,<br />
I’ve got those gamblers’ blues.</p>
