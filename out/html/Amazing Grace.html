<h1 class="title">Amazing Grace</h1>
</header>
<p>Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)<br />
That sav’d a wretch like me!<br />
I once was lost, but now am found,<br />
Was blind, but now I see.</p>
<p>’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br />
And grace my fears reliev’d;<br />
How precious did that grace appear<br />
The hour I first believ’d!</p>
<p>Thro’ many dangers, toils, and snares,<br />
I have already come;<br />
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,<br />
And grace will lead me home.</p>
<p>The Lord has promis’d good to me,<br />
His word my hope secures;<br />
He will my shield and portion be<br />
As long as life endures.</p>
<p>Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,<br />
And mortal life shall cease;<br />
I shall possess, within the veil,<br />
A life of joy and peace.</p>
<p>The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,<br />
The sun forbear to shine;<br />
But God, who call’d me here below,<br />
Will be forever mine.</p>
<p>John Newton, Olney Hymns, 1779</p>
