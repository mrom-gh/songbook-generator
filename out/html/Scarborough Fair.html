<p>Male part:</p>
<pre><code>Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  
Remember me to one who lives there,  
For she was once a true love of mine.  

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  
Without any seam or needlework,  
Then she shall be a true love of mine.  

Tell her to wash it in yonder well,  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  
Where never sprung water or rain ever fell,  
And she shall be a true lover of mine.  

Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn,  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  
Which never bore blossom since Adam was born,  
Then she shall be a true lover of mine.   </code></pre>
<p>Female part:</p>
<pre><code>Now he has asked me questions three,  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  
I hope he&#39;ll answer as many for me,  
Before he shall be a true lover of mine.  

Tell him to buy me an acre of land,  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  
Between the salt water and the sea sand,  
Then he shall be a true lover of mine.  

Tell him to plough it with a ram&#39;s horn,  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  
And sow it all over with one peppercorn,  
And he shall be a true lover of mine.  

Tell him to sheer&#39;t with a sickle of leather,  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  
And bind it up with a peacock&#39;s feather,  
And he shall be a true lover of mine.  

Tell him to thrash it on yonder wall,  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme,  
And never let one corn of it fall,  
Then he shall be a true lover of mine.  

When he has done and finished his work.  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme:  
Oh, tell him to come and he&#39;ll have his shirt,  
And he shall be a true lover of mine.   </code></pre>
